# Django installation requirements

Below is a list of the key software that will be required for Journalism 4462/7462 (Advanced Data Journalism), along with some resources offering tips about how to get it installed. Note that this software will all have to be installed and working before the third week of class! You'll receive in-class help getting everything up and running during the first two weeks.

## Python

The main programming language we'll be working in is Python. If you're using a Mac, you should already have it installed. If you're using a PC, you can install it using [this self-installer.](http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi)

** Be sure you install Python 2.6 or 2.7, NOT Python 3.0 **

## SQLite

This is the primary database manager we'll be using. Everyone should already have it installed, even if you don't know it. But if you want to be sure, feel free to install [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). It comes with SQLite included.

## easy_install and pip

To make our lives easier, Python comes with two package management tools, which allow us to install new packages that extend Python's core functionality. You'll probably need some help getting these up and running, but here are some basic instructions:

On Windows: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windows

On OSX: easy_install should already be included. To install pip, simply type ```sudo easy_install pip``` and enter your administrative password.
